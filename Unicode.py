# the main problem with the computer is that it doesnot understand the labguage of A OR B it only understands 0 and 1
#so there is a strong need of maaping between the numbers
# this is called ASCI
# American standard code for interchange
# the ord means ordinal
#so
print(ord('H')); #it will give the number mapped to H
# in python 2 all strings are not uni code u make themuni by appending u at the start
# while in case of python 3 all SRTRINGS ARE UNICODE
# WHEN YOU APPEND B AT THE  start of the string it means the BYTE string in python 2
# all strings in pyhton 2 are byte string
#lets see
s=b'abc'
print(s)
z=type(s)
print(z)  # it will, tell the class bytes in py 3 but in 2 it will print the str class

# in py 3 the BYTE AND THE REGULAR STRING ARE DIFFERENT
