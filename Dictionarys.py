# dictionary arelike the mini database with no ordered elements
# there are labels of elements in a dictionary
# the example of dictionary is just like a bag with unordered books
o=dict(); # o is an object of dictionary
o['money']=12;
o['price']=14;
o['number']=2;
# here money is the label and 12 is the element
# in short the label of 122 in dictionary is money
print(o);
# to  print something out we write or refer to it with the label assigned to it
# for example
print(o['money'])  # this will print the value
print(o['money']+2)  # this will add 2 to the value
